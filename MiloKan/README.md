# Add mention of tweet routing in MiloKan README
# Append below existing section

## Tweet routing (optional)

You can forward a tweet to the bot (e.g., via a custom Telegram command) and have the bot post it to X.
- Send the message in the format:
  ```text
  /tweet This is my new tweet content
  ```
- The bot will use the X client in `MiloKan` to publish it.

(Implementation details left to your integration.)
