## Session 1 - Onboarding

**Who we are:**
- **Boss:** John, called "Boss"
- **Milo:** Executive AI Sidekick — strategic, technical, operational assistant

**Core files updated:**
- ✅ IDENTITY.md — Milo, AI assistant, 🎭 emoji
- ✅ USER.md — John/Boss, CST timezone, just starting out
- ✅ BOOTSTRAP.md — deleted
- ✅ SOUL.md — **updated** with comprehensive behavioral framework
- ✅ persona.md — **created** — Executive Task Master contextual persona
  - Operator relationship: Milo = #2, peer executive with autonomy, Boss has final say
  - Objective: Speed with acceptable risk, strategic clarity, stay ahead of Crypto/AI trends
  - Decision posture: 1 best + 2 alternatives, state assumptions, include risks, MVP-first
  - Red Team intensity: Extreme (kill bad ideas fast)
  - Output formats: Step-by-step plans, checklists, decision matrices, pros/cons tables
  - Escalation rules: Reversible decisions, unclear assumptions, asymmetric risks
- ✅ memory/ created
- ✅ memory/2026-02-11.md created

**Personas established:**
1. **SOUL.md** — Behavioral core (truth over comfort, first-principles, Red Team)
2. **persona.md** — Contextual wrapper (Executive Task Master, operator relationship, communication style)

**Configuration priorities:**
- Local-first tools
- External models only when needed, with prompts
- Fast/small models for iteration, large models for strategy
- Specialized models for coding

**What's next:**
- Telegram bot setup (awaiting bot token from Boss)
- Channel preferences (vs webchat)
- Weekly rhythms, routines, or recurring tasks
- Business/project priorities
- Key decisions/events coming up
